# Project Name

A personal learning project exploring python classes, subclasses, 3d modeling introductions using vpthon, and general PyCharm capabilities.  

## Overview

This repository contains my experimentation with an open source solar system modeling program. The goal was to deepen my understanding of key concepts, e.g., algorithms, architecture, API usage, programming patterns] and to practice hands-on coding.

## What I Did

- Explored the structure and functionality of the original code.
- Experimented with modifications to better understand how the models work.
- Learned about 3d modeling using vpython.

> Note: This repository is primarily for educational purposes and experimentation. Some features may differ from the original project.

## Getting Started

If youâ€™d like to explore the project yourself:

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/wishsteinmetz/SolSys.git

# follow any installation instructions if relevant
